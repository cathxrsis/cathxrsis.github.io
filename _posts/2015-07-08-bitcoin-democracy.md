*This essay is currently being written. Apologies if you thought that I'm organised enough to actually write it :P.*

Direct democracy has always been one of the main goals of the libertarian left but, due to issues of practicality, is often thought of as an unobtainable ideal. In this essay (the first in a series on practical politics), a model will be proposed for a practical system showing, not just that direct democracy is possible but also that it is very much implementable in today's world.

From a British perspective, modern democracy leaves a lot to be desired. The "first past the post" system means that the British majority government can be voted in by a minority of voters (e.g. our current government only received @@% of the public's votes @@REF) and the lobbying system currently in place grants corporate voices far more swaying power over legislation. This fact is reflected in the YouGov polls showing public opinion is in favour of renationalisation of the @@REF FROM THE ESTAABLISHMENT BOOK.

It is very evident that most ordinary people do not have a say in how the country is run. This has led to a government that is not held accountable for actions that are mainly in the interest of corporate giants. Democracy in the UK is in dire need of reform; a new democratic system that can both create more representative governments and hold legislators to account. One proposed solution to these problems would be to created a democratic system based on tokens.

### A token based democracy

Token is the name given to a reusable form of vote. A token would be given to each eligible citizen in the country.  The proposed token based democracy would require that each piece of legislation created by the legislators (e.g. the house of commons) to be passed by the citizens of the country by placing their tokens on either the "yes" or "no" side or abstaining from the vote. 

Of course, a system this simple could not work in practice as the high frequency of bills being created would quickly lead to large amounts of voter apathy, an argument usually given against direct democracy. Thanks to the nature of the token though, a way of reducing the amount of interference caused by constant legislation whilst still preserving individuals direct voting power is possible.
