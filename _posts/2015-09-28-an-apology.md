Over the last few weeks I have been completely snowed under by my relocation to Hertfordshire and the beginning of my new job. It's been horrendously busy but I'm pretty excited that I'm finally actually making a contribution to modern civilisation (*read: making money*). Unfortunately for you people, there are a couple of essays in the pipeline, one being a shameless plug for my pet project of an open think tank. Cheers for reading and all that, hopefully I'll churn those essays out soon.
