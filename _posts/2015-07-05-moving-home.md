I've been getting a bit pissed off with google's blogger system and decided to migrate to Jekyll. Let me tell you, it's fucking great.
To be completely honest, I only actually ever managed a few posts on my Blogger page, this was mainly due to the faff of having to log online and paste my posts into the blogger form (which invariably buggers up).
Jekyll, on the other hand, lets me write the posts in the comfort of my own IDE (vim of course) which I then simply have to push to github pages using `git push`.
