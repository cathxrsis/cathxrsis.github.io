title: "Validation Through Intimidation"
---

This post is a short one to start the year and is about an anti-pattern that I have observed within systems engineering projects. I sincerely hope that this pattern is not endemic, though I suspect its more prevalent in the discipline than we'd like to admit. This anti-pattern is a possible mechanism to the prevalence of project cost & time overruns and complex systems often being a disappointment to their customers. I call this anti-pattern **Validation Through Intimidation**.

Validation
----------

Firstly, validation is the name given to the process of ensuring that @@ This is opposed to verification which is the process of ensuring that a design is correct against requirements. Where verification is a process internal to a project to ensure coherence, validation is ultimately external as it requires input from the stakeholders and knowledge of the contextual environment of the system under design.
