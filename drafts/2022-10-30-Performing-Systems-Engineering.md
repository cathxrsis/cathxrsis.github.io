title: "Performance---A New Perspective on Systems Engineering"

Making distinctions is one of the most important concepts within systems theory. Therefore, I want to start this post by making a distinction across the various frameworks and ideas from the history of systems theory. Those that place emphasis on the *Darkness Principle* and those that do not.

The darkness principle states that no component of a system can understand the behaviour of the whole system. This 

This is not to say that some systems thinkers disregard the darkness principle completely, rather, they believe that we can understand complex systems to a degree where there will be no significant surprises. These thinkers believe that it should be possible to construct a regulator (be that politically or mechanically) that can ensure a steady enough state for any system that we might care about. 

Notably, this line of thinking leads to 

@@ASHBYs LAW

The other side of systems thinking invests more in the darkness principle 

# Traditions

Historically, the systems thinking of the Soviet Union and USA tend to fall into the category of practice that do not place emphasis upon the darkness principle.



# In Systems Engineering

This is the bit where we have to turn our criticism inwards upon INCOSE.
