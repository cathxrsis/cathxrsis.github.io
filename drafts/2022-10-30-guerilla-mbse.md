title: "Guerilla MBSE"
---

This post is the culmination of some thoughts that I've had on an experience where I failed to enact an MBSE transformation in a company that I worked at. The failure was not around planting the seeds of the MBSE revolution; there is much more MBSE use in the company than when my colleagues and I started ^[By MBSE use, I mean the development of useful models that aren't just disjointed pictures.]. However, my colleagues and I found ourselves burnt out by the process. None of the MBSE experts from our team still work for the company.
