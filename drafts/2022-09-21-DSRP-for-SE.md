This is a post that I've been meaning to write for a while. My first salaried job was as a systems engineer in an aerospace company where projects would spend a decade or two from initiation to manufacture. When I moved to the automotive sector, the rate at which engineering occurred gave me a serious case of culture shock. It became clear to me that traditional methods of systems engineering, although perfectly adequate for the slow-burn projects of aerospace & defence, were not reactive enough to solve the systems problems in automotive. Frustratingly, the projects of the automotive industry were in more dire need of systems thinking due to their higher complexity than even the aerospace domain.

So I began the task of developing new processes and methods @@ However, the theoretical principles that I needed to base my processes upon were not being adequately supplied by INCOSE. This meant that the processes and methods were entirely practice based and I had very few pointers to directions of improvement when they didn't work as expected.
