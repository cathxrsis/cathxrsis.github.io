title: "The System of Government---Currency and Power"

---

As systems thinkers/engineers seeking to understand the dynamics of the systems we're operating within, we often find ourselves having to form an understanding of systems above us in the hierarchy to solve problems within our system. Possible the highest level of human built system that we come across is that of the government. With the sort of jobs that systems thinkers tend to find themselves on, you're bound to have to deal with a government at some point in your career. Therefore, this post is an exploration into applying the systems lens to government. 

What is a Government?
---------------------

The first definition of government that I came across that made sense to me was Max Weber's from his 1919 essay *Economy and Society*:

> A compulsory political organization with continuous operations will be called a 'state' [if and] insofar as its administrative staff successfully upholds a claim to the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force (das Monopol legitimen physischen Zwanges) in the enforcement of its order.
