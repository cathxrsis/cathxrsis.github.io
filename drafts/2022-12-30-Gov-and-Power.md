As systems thinkers/engineers seeking to understand the dynamics of the systems we're operating within, we often find ourselves having to form an understanding of systems above us in the hierarchy to solve problems within our system.

Weber here was talking about modern states (at least during the modern era). By 'monopoly of legitimate physical force' he was talking about how the state is imbued with the 'right' to grant which acts of violence are deemed legitimate and which aren't.
