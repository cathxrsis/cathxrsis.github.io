title: "A Functional Requirements Authoring Grammar"

This post is the culmination of a thread of thought that I've been working on for around eight years. In a previous company, I was tasked with authoring the requirements writing spec for the @@

Writing requirements is hard,

## Why?

I am a big fan of Alistair Maven's Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax (EARS).

However, Maven has named his EARS precisely---it is a syntax, not a grammar. So, what is the difference between syntax and grammar?

A Syntax is part of grammar. Syntax defines the structure of sentences of a language.

As noted by linguist Noam Chomsky, "Colourless green ideas sleep furiously." is a syntactically correct sentence in the English language, however, it's contradictory nonsense.

The counterpart to syntax within grammar that gives sentences meaning is semantics.

## The Functional Requirements Authoring Grammar Semantics

A set of requirements specifies, for a system of interest, constrains the set of system's attributes and relationships between these attributes. So called non-functional requirements specify the constraints of around an attribute whereas functional requirements specify how some 'output' or 'actuated' attribute changes with respect to changes in some 'input' or 'sensed' attributes.

Therefore, in FRAG, we imagine the system of interest at a certain level of abstraction as a set of these attributes and relationships. This puts FRAG at

## Comparison to EARS semantics

EARS specifies six different types of requirements

### Ubiquitous Requirements

### While or Stateful Requirements

### When or Event Driven Requirements

### Where or Variant Driven Requirements

### If or Failure Response Requirements

FRAG does not contain a separate category or keyword for failure response requirements. This is a conscious decision

## FRAG's new Statement Types

## Context Free and Context Sensitive Requirements

Many requirements frameworks and guidelines state that requirements

## The Functional Requirements Authoring Grammar Syntax

Finally, here's the authoring grammar in all its glory:

**FRAGAttribute:**

![FRAGAttribute](diagram/FRAGAttribute.svg)

```
FRAGAttribute
         ::= Subject Operator 'have' ( 'a' | 'an' ) Measurable Constraints '.'
```

**FRAGFunctionCS:**

![FRAGFunctionCS](diagram/FRAGFunctionCS.svg)

```
FRAGFunctionCS
         ::= Function Name ( '\n' ( ( Preconditions | 'Otherwise,' ) '\n' '\tab' )? FRAGRequirement )+
```

**FRAGFunctionCF:**

![FRAGFunctionCF](diagram/FRAGFunctionCF.svg)

```
FRAGFunctionCF
         ::= FunctionName '\n' ( FRAGRequirement '\n' )+
```

**FRAGRequirement:**

![FRAGRequirement](diagram/FRAGRequirement.svg)

```
FRAGRequirement
         ::= Preconditions* Trigger? Subject Operator Action Constraints '.'
```

referenced by:

* FRAGFunctionCF
* FRAGFunctionCS

**Preconditions:**

![Preconditions](diagram/Preconditions.svg)

```
Preconditions
         ::= 'While' ( Measurable Comparitor Expression Units ( '&' | ',' ) )+
```

referenced by:

* FRAGFunctionCS
* FRAGRequirement

**Trigger:**

![Trigger](diagram/Trigger.svg)

```
Trigger  ::= ( 'when' | 'When' ) Measurable 'becomes' Comparitor? Expression Units ','
```

referenced by:

* FRAGRequirement

**Subject:**

![Subject](diagram/Subject.svg)

```
Subject  ::= 'the' SystemName
```

referenced by:

* FRAGAttribute
* FRAGRequirement

**Operator:**

![Operator](diagram/Operator.svg)

```
Operator ::= 'must'
           | 'shall'
           | 'should'
           | 'may'
           | 'can'
```

* FRAGAttribute
* FRAGRequirement

**Action:**

![Action](diagram/Action.svg)

```
Action   ::= ( 'produce' | 'set' | 'actuate' ) Measurable ( 'as' | 'to' ) Expression Units
```

referenced by:

* FRAGRequirement

**Constraints:**

![Constraints](diagram/Constraints.svg)

``` EBNF
Constraints
         ::= 'with' ( ( 'a' | 'an' ) DegreeOfFreedom 'of' Comparitor Expression Units ( ',' | 'and' ) )+
```

referenced by:

* FRAGAttribute
* FRAGRequirement

**Comparitor:**

![Comparitor](diagram/Comparitor.svg)

``` EBNF
Comparitor
         ::= '>'
           | '<'
           | '≤'
           | '≥'
           | '='
           | '≠'
```
