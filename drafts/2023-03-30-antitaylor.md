What is Taylorism? it goes by a few names: Fordism, Scientific Management. It is the framework or ideology used to manage modern capitalism---the reasoning used to justify the current division of labour and the modern management structure.

Taylorism goes something like this: problems are *analysed*---broken down to smaller and smaller problems until the problems are small enough to be solved by a single person. The traditional lens of Taylorism is the factory. A manufacturing problem is broken down into parts which flow together via conveyor belts and are manipulated by individuals at work stations.

Taylorism then applies a set of measurements to this process for the purposes of planning and intervening when things don't go to plan.

### Agile

Agile is a the name given to a set of organisational practices that adhere to the principles and values of the Agile Manifesto.

However, Taylorism fights back against Agile by reasserting itself in various ways. A common form of the Taylorist reassertion over an Agile process is so-called *Dark Scrum*.

## Why Taylorism Persists

Why does Taylorism, as described here, continue to persist and reassert itself within modern capitalism despite its productive efficiency shortcomings compared to other frameworks? My assertion to answer this question is that Taylorism produces and ideological justification for profit.

Let's get back to basics, value is created from human labour. This is the Labour Theory of Value and comes from
