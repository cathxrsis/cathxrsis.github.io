title: "Desire and Viability or When is a Desiring machine Viable"
---

I mentioned in a previous post that the Desiring Machine pattern lies somewhere between a cybernetic loop and a Beerian Viable System in the zoo of cybernetic patterns. In this post, I would like to expain what I meant by that as well as using the framework of interacting desiring machines to understand some system pathologies. First, however, lets have a refresh of what a desiring machine is.

The Desiring Machine
--------------------

The Desiring Machine is a pattern to which some systems may conform. It typifies systems that make changes in their environment based on a goal that can change based on processes internal to the system. This differentiates it from systems like homeostats where the goal of the system is set externally. The basic form of a Desiring Machine is shown here:

The key objects in a desiring machine are:

The Environment

  : The surroundings of the desiring machine that the machine exists within

Desiring Machines as an OODA loop

Viable Desiring Machines
------------------------

Stafford Beer's Viable system model is a cybernetic pattern that allows us understand whether a system is viable and what may be missing from a system that is not. It is constructed of 5 sub-systems that all have purposes that culminate in the viability of the system. A great explainer of the VSM can be found here @@. These systems and how they are related to the Desiring machine are listed below:

System 1

  : The sub-system that brings value by acting upon the environment of the system. This is the Action process of the Desiring Machine.

System 2

  : The sub-system that monitors the multiple System 1s and ensures that there are no contradictions between the actions of these systems.

System 3

  : This sub system 

System 4

  : This sub-system monitors the environment and attempts to 

System 5

  : This sub-system maintains the 'ethos' of the system. It does acts as th @@ In terms of the Desiring Machine, System 5 comprises the Ideal and the processes of Critique, Desire and Meaning.

Pathologies of the Desiring Machine
-----------------------------------

We have covered the relations between the OODA loop, VSM and the Desiring Machine. The OODA loop is a great model for understanding how to win inter-system conflicts whereas the VSM is a model for understanding how to build cohesive and resilient (viable) systems. The desiring machine, sits in between these two in this sense too by giving us a framework to understand intra-system conflicts, namely those that happen between levels of hierarchy.
