title: "On the Phenomenon of 9-5 Systems Engineers"
---

This post describes a phenomenon that I and some other systems engineers that I've spoken too have noticed about our discipline. This phenomenon is entirely anecdotal so I could be working in outlier companies or completely wrong. If this post rings true or false for you, howevever, I'd love to hear from you in the comments. 

My null hypothesis is this: compared to other diciplines of engineering, there are proportionally far fewer *vocational* systems engineers. By *vocational*, I am referring to the idea of engineers who see the subject of their job as more than just what they do 9-5 to pay the bills.

Vocational engineers are those who  spend considerable time outside of their job working on related hobbies and/or contributing to their discipline. Examples are mechanical engineers who restore cars, electronic engineers who automate their homes or software engineers who contribute to open source projects. You know the types---in large companies, they often band together and spend lunchtimes drone racing, soapbox racer building or organising an inter-departmental hackathon. 

Amongst the systems engineering discipline, though, there seems to be far fewer of these vocational types. The systems engineering community is indeed smaller than the other engineering disciplines but is the *proportion* that I'm concerned about. Most other systems engineers that I've worked with would often rather be down in a discipline such as electronics or mechanics.

This post is not an indictment of these 'happenstance' systems engineers---they often do a very good job. However, those that see themselves as systems engineers by *vocation* have an impetus to push the discipline forward---those with an emotional and identitarian investment in the discipline are much more likely to want to make a name for themselves within the community.

So, let's explore some of the aspects of the modern SE environment that may be leading to this phenomenon.

The Systems Engineering Community
---------------------------------

To start trying to answer this question, I want to ask what does the systems engineering community look like? In three words: Old, White, Men. By community, I'm talking about those who engage with the discipline professionally through INCOSE, SCiO and other groups (I'd also like to point out that my experience is mainly in the UK). Therefore the community can feel exclusionary to those not in that category^[It may also lead to old white men believing that they can get away with abhorrent behaviours.].

The community is also very aerospace and defence focussed. This is fair enough as these domains have put the most resources into developing the discipline in the past. 

Academic Systems Engineering
----------------------------

Academic systems engineering seems to be in decline

Systems Engineering within Companies
------------------------------------

The lack of systems engineers coming out of academia has led to a dearth of systems engineers within industry. Some companies have, admirably, risen to this challenge and hire graduates/apprentices with a view to training them in good systems practice from scratch. I myself was lucky enough to find myself on such a graduate scheme.

This brings with it the risk that these new hires will not enjoy the discipline that they have entered with no prior experience of. Personally, I had no idea what systems engineering was when I got onto my summer placement in it. It was, perhaps, pure luck that I would find something that I'm so passionate about so early in my career. Some of my contemporaries found that systems was not for them. Some are still systems engineers, some have defected to other disciplines, industries or vocations.

Perhaps this willingness to train systems engineers from scratch in these few companies has lessened the demand on SE as an undergraduate degree.

### Parasite Companies

The demand for systems engineers is still high, perhaps more so than other disciplines today. This is exacerbated by the rise of what I call *parasite companies*. *Parasite Companies* are those that refuse to invest in their own staff. Often consultants, these companies hire in new talent whenever they need it to fulfil a contract but see training-to-fit as too big an overhead. 

These companines are typified by a low training budget and high turnover of staff, especially amongst those in their early career who feel as though their careers are being stunted before they've even begun. Companies like this can be effective machines for destroying a budding systems engineer's passion.

### Electrical Integrators

Many compa

- No systems thinking in management
- see problem at test and integration
- Hire where problem is and hire wrong skills
- Don't know what good systems looks like

### Systems as Firefighters

Systems engineers often find themselves in a privileged position within companies when it comes to firefighting. In complex systems, the sort of defects that make it through to the final stages of a project are often those that are emergent---defects that are causedd by the mis-interactions of many subsystems of the product. In the cases of emergent defects, systems engineers are far better placed to find efficient fixes to these defects and save the project.

It is worth noting that this central role of a project means that systems engineers find themselves building working realtionships with a far greater range of engineers than other disciplines. This privilege often works to propel systems engineers into central management roles at a greater rate than other engineering disciplines^[Systems engineers can progress almost as fast as PMs in the right environment.].

This mechanism may explain why systems engineers make up a large part of the management in companies with longer histories of systems engineering. This mechanism also gives systems engineering a draw factor to those who have ambitions for management. 

Paternalism
-----------

Perhaps because of the academic landscape, the demographics of the community or the industries that dominate the discipline, systems engineering has a problem with paternalism. What do I mean by this? 

- Lack of dissemination of systems thinking and theory
- Lots of dumbing down into frameworks by well meaning 
- Circular causation with the lack of passion in SE?
- Training becomes paternalistic

How might we go about fixing this?
----------------------------------

To reiterate the premise in different terms, systems engineering as a discipline needs to foster a greater number of *vocational* systems engineers to ensure that it can innovate and solve the ever-complex problems of the future. Above I have explored what may be causing this perceived problem, so now its time to suggest some ways forward to fixing it.
