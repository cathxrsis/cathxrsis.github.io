What is Object-Oriented Ontology?

- The metaphor is

- Learning = metaphor

- Joke (what makes a good joke?)


Learning:

- Current model = OM
- New sensory pattern = SP
- New SP added to OM to create OM'
- Added as new emergent property (EP) to OM.

Metaphor (Deep learning):

- Current model = OM
- OM given new EPs of another OM
- OM2 added to OM1 to create OM'
- OM' now has the EPs of OM1 and OM2

Joke (Model Shattering):
- Current model = OM
- New SP
- SP incompatible with current OM
- OM' constructed from other OMs so that the new EPs are compatible with the SPs.
