<p>This post is a short one about an­other an­tipat­tern that I’ve ob­served while work­ing. Its tech­ni­cally an in­stance of a com­mon an­tipat­tern of how lo­cally op­ti­mised sys­tems of­ten don’t com­bine into sys­tems that are op­ti­mised for the larg­er-s­cale goal. The par­tic­u­larly in­sid­i­ous part of this an­tipat­tern is that not only does it in­crease the risk of project fail­ure, it also hurts team morale and in­di­vid­u­al’s men­tal health.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-incentivise-failure">How to In­cen­tivise Fail­ure</h2>
<p>The an­swer is quite sim­ple: to in­cen­tivise project fail­ure, make in­di­vid­ual team mem­bers re­spon­si­ble for the work that they pro­duce. Hang on an min­ute! is­n’t that what we do in every com­pa­ny? should­n’t peo­ple be re­spon­si­ble for their own ac­tions?</p>
<p>Un­for­tu­nate­ly, it’s not that sim­ple.</p>
<p>Let’s fol­low this through with an ex­am­ple. Most tasks in busi­nesses re­quire mul­ti­ple peo­ple to com­mu­ni­cate to­gether to pro­duce the out­come of an analy­sis of some sort or make a de­ci­sion. In­deed, <em>the very logic be­hind the fact that we have or­gan­i­sa­tions is that teams of peo­ple can pro­duce things that in­di­vid­u­als sim­ply can­not</em>.</p>
<p>In a nor­mal <em>run of the mill</em> Tay­lorist or­gan­i­sa­tion, the man­age­ment cre­ate a work break­down struc­ture, un­til the over­all task is bro­ken up into chunks that can be com­pleted in rea­son­able time by in­di­vid­u­als. It is the job of the man­age­ment to re­ward these in­di­vid­u­als when they do a good job and pun­ish them when they do a bad job. The man­age­ment may also pro­vide train­ing to in­di­vid­u­als to en­sure that they un­der­stand what they’re sup­posed to be do­ing and can do it well.</p>
<p>so far so good.</p>
<p>But what hap­pens when such an or­gan­i­sa­tion is goes into a state of cri­sis or stress? The first thing to go is of­ten the train­ing. <em>“We don’t have time/­money to put you through train­ing un­til the end of the pro­ject”</em> say man­age­ment. Stress also makes peo­ple grumpy. Man­agers, re­spon­si­ble for their team’s work, be­gin mi­cro­manag­ing their team mem­bers to avoid a per­ceived risk of dis­ci­pli­nary ac­tions from higher man­age­ment. Team mem­bers find them­selves un­der more stress and dis­ci­pli­nary scruti­ny. This is es­pe­cially true when the long screw­drivers come out­–when higher man­age­ment start mi­cro­manag­ing.</p>
<p>The ef­fects on in­di­vid­u­als within a team are stark. Those who may not be skilled enough to do the work be­gin falling be­hind. Those who are com­fort­able with their work­load of­ten be­gin to gold-­plate their out­put to gain praise from man­age­ment when they could be help­ing out their col­leagues. If the stress is too great, even those who are ex­cep­tional work­ers may find their dead­lines are only just man­age­able. Be­cause of Tay­lorist work break­down meth­ods that fo­cus on the di­vi­sion of labour, if one or more in­di­vid­u­als fail to de­liv­er, the whole project has failed.</p>
<p>Fail­ure of the project is in­cen­tivised.</p>
<p>This state is of­ten know as <em>crunch</em> and it is well know in the games in­dus­try for pro­duc­ing bug­gy, un­fin­ished prod­ucts. Think Cy­ber­punk 2077 or any Bethesda game. Imag­ine what it does to sys­tems like cars and air­craft where user’s life are on the line.</p>
<p>As Stafford Beer pointed out, many or­gan­i­sa­tions be­come ad­dicted to stress and be­come locked in a per­ma­nent un­sus­tain­able cri­sis mode. Com­pa­nies can be­come ad­dicted to it, con­tin­u­ously burn­ing out their best work­ers and alien­at­ing those who may need up­skilling. A high turnover of staff is a com­mon in­di­ca­tor that this cul­ture has taken root.</p>
<h2 id="possible-solutions-joint-responsibility">Pos­si­ble So­lu­tions: Joint Re­spon­si­bil­ity</h2>
<p>Scrum and the think­ing around it has pro­vided us with some pretty good so­lu­tions to this is­sue. In Scrum (and other ag­ile meth­od­s), the team takes re­spon­si­bil­ity for de­liv­ery–they suc­ceed to­gether and fail to­geth­er. If the whole team is re­spon­si­ble for de­liv­ery, the team be­gins to help each other out, de­velop each other and are more likely to suc­ceed. In­di­vid­ual in­cen­tives be­come aligned with that of the over­all project and suc­cess be­comes more like­ly.</p>
