<p>What fol­lows is a pa­per that I sub­mit­ted for IN­COSE UK’s ASEC 2021 Con­fer­ence. Un­for­tu­nate­ly, the pa­per was not ac­cepted which is fair enough as the pre­sen­ta­tions that made it into the con­fer­ence were all in­cred­i­bly in­ter­est­ing, use­ful and well pre­sent­ed. How­ev­er, de­spite my pre­sen­ta­tion skills, this method brought a lot of ben­e­fit when used at Jaguar Land Rover and I present it here so that oth­ers can ben­e­fit from it too.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Many sys­tems processes leave most of their in­te­gra­tion ac­tiv­i­ties on the
right-hand-­side of the Vee. This can re­sult in func­tion­al­ity be­ing lost
in the gap be­tween sub­sys­tems or du­pli­cated across sub­sys­tems. These
de­fects, em­bed­ded in the re­quire­ments, may only be­come clear dur­ing
in­te­gra­tion test­ing or later where the cost of rec­ti­fi­ca­tion is high­er.
This prob­lem is com­pounded by sub­-op­ti­mal com­mu­ni­ca­tion struc­tures that
are in­her­ent in siloed or­gan­i­sa­tions and even more so when en­gi­neers are
highly dis­trib­uted due to home work­ing.</p>
<p>In projects where new be­hav­iours (fea­tures) are con­tin­u­ously in­te­grated
onto ex­ist­ing sys­tems, emer­gent be­hav­iours can oc­cur when new fea­tures
in­ter­fere with ex­ist­ing ones. A mod­el-based whole sys­tem func­tional
ar­chi­tec­ture would al­low us to un­der­stand these emer­gent be­hav­iours.
Such a model would also pro­vide a “s­in­gle source of truth” that would
aid in pre­vent­ing du­pli­cated re­quire­ments and high­light miss­ing
func­tion­al­i­ty. Un­for­tu­nate­ly, ex­ist­ing meth­ods of func­tional analy­sis
re­sult in sets of func­tions that can­not eas­ily be “stitched to­geth­er” to
cre­ate such a mod­el.</p>
<p>Pre­sented is a novel ap­proach to func­tional analy­sis, in­spired by
func­tional pro­gram­ming, that en­ables greater com­pos­abil­ity of the
func­tions cre­at­ed. The method fo­cuses on the in­for­ma­tion flow around the
sys­tem as the ba­sis of defin­ing func­tion­al­ity and pro­hibits the use of
con­trol flow. This method has been in use within JLR for 3 years and is
per­formed on all new fea­tures. This has re­sulted in a model with over
6000 func­tions from many con­trib­u­tors across the com­pa­ny. This model has
al­lowed us to per­form analy­ses to catch emer­gent be­hav­iours of the
fea­ture; more eas­ily per­form fail­ure analy­sis and gives us a stan­dard
“cur­ren­cy” with which to cas­cade re­quire­ments to sub­sys­tems.</p>
<h1 id="introduction">In­tro­duc­tion</h1>
<p>Per­form­ing a func­tional analy­sis for a sys­tem is a com­mon step in the
re­quire­ments analy­sis process. It al­lows sys­tems en­gi­neers to de­com­pose
the ‘black box’ sys­tem re­quire­ments of a sys­tem of in­ter­est (SoI) into
chunks that can be al­lo­cated to sub­sys­tems [p.48 SMC 2005]. Func­tional
de­com­po­si­tion also en­ables meth­ods such as N<sup>2</sup> analy­sis so that
en­gi­neers can de­fine bet­ter sub­sys­tem ar­chi­tec­tures to ful­fil their
stake­hold­er’s needs.</p>
<p>Func­tions can there­fore form a “cur­ren­cy” which can be used for
re­quire­ments al­lo­ca­tion and trace­abil­ity from a SoI to its sub­sys­tems;
the method with which we use to cre­ate our func­tions is key to en­sur­ing
that this later work is ef­fec­tive in cre­at­ing bet­ter sys­tem
ar­chi­tec­tures.</p>
<p>The method pre­sented in this pa­per does not cover the iden­ti­fi­ca­tion of
func­tions that are black­-box sys­tem lev­el; re­ferred to as fea­tures
here­after. Rather, it cov­ers the de­com­po­si­tion of fea­tures to a level
that can be al­lo­cated to sub­sys­tems. Fea­tures are of­ten de­vel­oped us­ing
use case analy­sis; the fea­ture is the be­hav­iour of the SoI, in re­sponse
to stim­uli dur­ing the use case, to achieve the goal and sat­isfy the
stake­hold­er(s). Fea­tures can span mul­ti­ple use cas­es.</p>
<p>The method is only ap­plic­a­ble to the func­tional as­pects of a SoI; those
where causal­ity flows from in­puts to out­put. It is not a good fit for
mod­el­ling the physics of the use case where a para­met­ric model could be
bet­ter used.</p>
<h1 id="a-novel-method-for-functional-decomposition">A Novel Method for Func­tional De­com­po­si­tion</h1>
<p>Fea­tures of­ten have large over­laps with each oth­er; they re­spond to the
same stim­uli, pro­duce the same ac­tu­a­tions or con­tain the same
math­e­mat­i­cal re­la­tion­ships be­tween stim­u­la­tion and ac­tu­a­tion. If we were
to treat these fea­tures as atomic units in the en­gi­neer­ing process, it
would re­sult in du­pli­cated ef­fort.</p>
<p>This over­lap can also cause is­sues when the SoI is de­vel­oped
it­er­a­tive­ly. This is the ap­proach to en­gi­neer­ing that the au­to­mo­tive
sec­tor fol­lows. Each new sys­tem pro­duced is an it­er­a­tion of a
con­tin­u­ously up­dated ar­chi­tec­ture. In these cas­es, there is an in­creased
risk that new fea­tures will in­ter­fere with ex­ist­ing ones. This can cause
un­de­sir­able emer­gent be­hav­iours. With­out analy­sis to spot these emer­gent
be­hav­iours, they may only be caught dur­ing fi­nal val­i­da­tion of the
prod­uct as the is­sues are in­her­ent in the re­quire­ments.</p>
<p>Many func­tional de­com­po­si­tion meth­ods treat func­tions as the process of
com­plet­ing one of a se­quence of tasks that cul­mi­nate in the achieve­ment
of the goal. Of­ten the se­quenc­ing of the func­tions is shown us­ing a
con­trol flow graph. Ex­am­ples of this are Func­tional Flow Block Di­a­grams
pre­sented in the NASA SE Hand­book[­NASA 2007] and SysML ac­tiv­ity
di­a­grams [OMG 2018 SysML 1.6]. In­for­ma­tion flow is of­ten then added to
the de­com­po­si­tion af­ter­wards (or not at all as de­scribed in the SE­BoK
log­i­cal ar­chi­tec­ture pit­fall­s[SE­BOK 2020])</p>
<p>In this pa­per, a novel func­tional analy­sis method is pre­sented that
ad­dresses these con­cerns whilst be­ing sim­ple enough for en­gi­neers to
un­der­stand with min­i­mal train­ing. This method has been named the Miso
method as the func­tions pro­duced can have mul­ti­ple in­puts but only one
out­put.</p>
<p>The key idea be­hind the Miso method was the ques­tion:</p>
<h2 id="concerns-for-functional-analysis-methods"><em>Con­cerns for Func­tional Analy­sis Meth­ods</em></h2>
<p>Be­fore de­vel­op­ing a new method for func­tional analy­sis, we iden­ti­fied
stake­holder con­cerns that would need to be ad­dressed by the method.
These con­cerns were dis­cov­ered through dis­cus­sion with many stake­hold­ers
from around to busi­ness. To sum­marise, the new method should im­prove our
ca­pa­bil­i­ties to per­form im­pact as­sess­ments and fail­ure analy­ses; pro­duce
func­tions that are read­ily al­lo­ca­ble to the ex­ist­ing (and fu­ture)
sub­sys­tems; and ease writ­ing, re­view­ing and val­i­da­tion of re­quire­ments.
The method should also help us avoid an­ti-­pat­terns such as ‘hid­den’
in­for­ma­tion flow that can make fail­ure analy­sis and val­i­da­tion hard­er;
let­ting the so­lu­tion in­form the de­com­po­si­tion which can cause no longer
ap­plic­a­ble con­straints to af­fect the re­quire­ments; and help avoid
de­com­po­si­tion to the wrong level of ab­strac­tion.</p>
<h2 id="miso-functions"><em>Miso Func­tions</em></h2>
<p>A sign of a good method is re­peata­bil­i­ty: two en­gi­neers with the same
in­puts, sep­a­rated so they can’t com­mu­ni­cate, should pro­duce the same
out­come when fol­low­ing the method. With pre­vi­ous meth­ods of func­tional
analy­sis, this did not oc­cur. En­gi­neers of­ten dis­agreed on the
in­ter­faces of the func­tions. How­ev­er, they tended not to dis­agree on the
in­for­ma­tion flows in a fea­ture. This ex­pe­ri­ence in­spired the key idea
be­hind the method.</p>
<p>To en­sure re­peata­bil­i­ty, the en­gi­neer fol­lows a stan­dard method to
iden­tify the func­tions. The en­gi­neer first iden­ti­fies all in­for­ma­tion
that is flow­ing across the sys­tem bound­ary—s­tim­uli &amp; ac­tu­a­tion­s—and
the con­trol func­tions are just the de­pen­den­cies be­tween these
in­for­ma­tion flows. If you were to have drawn se­quence di­a­grams to
ex­press your use cases for the SoI, each mes­sage go­ing into or out from
the SoI’s life­line is one of these bound­ary-cross­ing flows. This also
en­sures a con­sis­tent level of ab­strac­tion across de­com­po­si­tions.</p>
<p>The main view of the Miso method is the en­hanced func­tional flow block
di­a­gram[­Long 1995](e­qi­va­lent­ly, SysML Ac­tiv­i­ties). Think­ing of
func­tions as the de­pen­den­cies be­tween in­for­ma­tion flows though gave the
di­a­grams some in­ter­est­ing prop­er­ties: there is no con­trol flow in the
Miso func­tional flow views which, some­what sur­pris­ing­ly, has not
re­sulted in a loss of ex­pres­sive­ness. The dis­tinc­tive
mul­ti­ple-in­put-s­in­gle-out­put sig­na­ture of the func­tions also arises from
think­ing of func­tions in this way.</p>

Type.</strong></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>With the Miso method, writ­ing re­quire­ments be­comes an ex­er­cise in
stat­ing which value is pro­duced by the func­tion for each com­bi­na­tion of
in­put val­ues. This makes the re­quire­ments pro­duced much eas­ier to re­view
as com­plete. This be­comes slightly more com­plex for state­ful func­tions
as de­scribed later in this pa­per.</p>
<p>In JLR we cre­ated new stereo­types on our func­tion el­e­men­t—«sense» and
«ac­tu­ate»—to rep­re­sent when in­for­ma­tion flow crosses the sys­tem
bound­ary. This could also be achieved with ac­tiv­ity pa­ra­me­ters in an
ac­tiv­ity di­a­gram as in Fig­ure 1. Though hav­ing spe­cific func­tion
el­e­ments here gives us a stan­dard el­e­ment in the mod­el­ling tool to
at­tach re­quire­ments for the SoI’s in­ter­faces.</p>
<p>Al­lo­cat­ing a Miso func­tion to a sub­sys­tem car­ries the mean­ing of
al­lo­cat­ing the re­spon­si­bil­ity to cre­ate the in­for­ma­tion flow pro­duced by
the Miso func­tion. That sub­sys­tem must also have ac­cess to the
in­for­ma­tion that the func­tion re­quires at its in­puts. This leads us
to­wards al­lo­ca­tion meth­ods where we can al­lo­cate our func­tions to
min­imise in­for­ma­tion flow across in­ter­faces as a sort of N<sup>2</sup> as-y­ou-­go.
Know­ing the de­pen­den­cies be­tween in­put and out­put val­ues can also give
you an un­der­stand­ing of the ‘size’ of the com­pu­ta­tion a func­tion
rep­re­sents (in rough big O no­ta­tion) and can in­form al­lo­ca­tion if
com­put­ing power is a con­straint.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="a-whole-system-functional-architecture"><em>A Whole-Sys­tem Func­tional Ar­chi­tec­ture</em></h2>
<p>:::</p>
<p>When it comes to reusing func­tions in a new fea­ture, if a func­tion has
mul­ti­ple out­puts, there is a risk that the novel fea­ture will only use a
sub­set of the out­puts in its be­hav­iour. This can lead to fea­tures
pick­ing up un­re­lated re­quire­ments when traced to their func­tional
de­com­po­si­tions. Miso func­tions solve this prob­lem el­e­gantly due to their
sin­gle out­put—if you re­quire the in­for­ma­tion cre­ated by that func­tion
then you reuse it, oth­er­wise, you do not.</p>
<p>An­other prob­lem that af­fects the com­po­si­tion of Miso func­tions into
fea­tures is the in­ter­pre­ta­tion of con­nec­tors. SysML ac­tiv­i­ties and
Simulink both treat the con­nec­tions be­tween func­tions as ‘pipes’. Un­like
C func­tions where func­tions are called to re­turn a value and then
dis­ap­pear back to obliv­ion, Miso func­tions should be in­ter­preted as
ma­chines that are ‘al­ways on’ and there­fore, the in­for­ma­tion flows
al­ways have a val­ue. For those in­ter­ested in cat­e­gory the­o­ry, be­cause of
this, Miso func­tions could be mod­elled as a spe­cial kind of cat­e­gory
known as a Freyd Cat­e­gory or Hugh­es’ Ar­rows [Hughes 2000].</p>
<p>The Miso method gives us the guar­an­tee that if an in­for­ma­tion flow is an
in­put to a func­tion then the out­put de­pends on it. This, cou­pled with
the li­brary and the whole-sys­tem func­tional ar­chi­tec­ture, al­lowed us to
fol­low func­tional flow back and for­ward through our SoI. An­other way
that the Miso method sup­ports this is by en­forc­ing that en­gi­neers
spec­ify all pos­si­ble val­ues of each in­for­ma­tion flow and whether the
func­tion gen­er­ates it as an event or a stream. By do­ing so, it is much
eas­ier to ap­ply fail­ure key­words in a HA­ZOP-­like method and to work out
which fail­ures are un­de­tectable and de­tectable. There­fore, this
iden­ti­fied im­pos­si­ble re­quire­ments where the down­stream func­tions were
re­act­ing to an un­de­tectable fail­ure.</p>
<p>In JLR, the whole sys­tem func­tional ar­chi­tec­ture took the form of a
SysML model that aims to con­tain all con­nec­tions be­tween all us­ages of
the func­tions in all pos­si­ble ve­hi­cles from 2019 on­wards. At the time of
writ­ing, there are over 6000 func­tions in this ar­chi­tec­ture, each
re­spon­si­ble for a unique in­for­ma­tion flow. This is ex­pected to grow at a
lin­ear rate into the fu­ture as more fea­tures are added to ve­hi­cles
bring­ing in new func­tions and doc­u­ment­ing legacy func­tions alike.</p>
<p>A di­a­gram view of this en­tire ar­chi­tec­ture would be be­yond
com­pre­hen­sion, so tools have been de­vel­oped to cre­ate views scoped to
in­di­vid­ual fea­tures on re­quest. Tools have also been de­vel­oped to en­able
the fol­low­ing of up­stream &amp; down­stream de­pen­den­cies be­tween func­tions so
that fail­ure analy­sis can be traced from stim­uli to ac­tu­a­tion in the
mod­el. This model pro­vides a firm foun­da­tion for the au­toma­tion of
analy­sis of emer­gent be­hav­iours be­tween fea­tures given a be­hav­ioural
spec­i­fi­ca­tion for each func­tion in a ma­chine-­parseable lan­guage.</p>
<h2 class="unnumbered" id="information-flow-values"><em>In­for­ma­tion Flow &amp; Val­ues</em></h2>
<p>Defin­ing the ex­tent of pos­si­ble val­ues for each in­for­ma­tion flow is an
im­por­tant part of the Miso method. Un­der­stand­ing the pos­si­ble in­put
com­bi­na­tions and out­puts of a func­tion is a good way for us to en­sure
that the re­quire­ments writ­ten from it are com­plete. There­fore, defin­ing
the value range for each out­put of a func­tion is a manda­tory part of the
method.</p>
<p>SysML Data Types pro­vide our main means of record­ing this in­for­ma­tion
but a ta­ble view for each func­tion could suf­fice in a non-­mod­el­ing
process. We took in­spi­ra­tion from func­tional pro­gram­ming’s use of
al­ge­braic data types [Milewski 2015] to en­sure that the syn­tax for
data types in the re­quire­ments was ex­pres­sive enough to cover
ar­bi­trar­ily com­plex in­for­ma­tion.</p>
<p>We also de­fined the Noth­ing value as a spe­cial value that could be added
to types to rep­re­sent a func­tion not pro­duc­ing any­thing. An ex­am­ple is
when an event based «sense» func­tion is not sens­ing an even­t—in these
cas­es, it is pro­duc­ing Noth­ing. This en­sures our re­quire­ments cover
con­di­tions where there is no stim­u­lus and that they are eas­ily
un­der­stood. This con­ven­tion was in­spired by the Maybe type used in many
func­tional pro­gram­ming lan­guages [Lipo­vača 2011].</p>
<h2 id="stateful-functions"><em>State­ful Func­tions</em></h2>
<p>An im­por­tant part of the Miso method is the iden­ti­fi­ca­tion of whether an
in­for­ma­tion flow is a to­ken (event based) or a stream (con­tin­u­ous) as it
pro­vides us with an easy way of iden­ti­fy­ing whether a func­tion is pure
or state­ful.</p>
<p>r0.5</p>
<p>Pure func­tions are those where, at any point in time, the out­put value
is en­tirely de­fined by the in­puts. There­fore re­quire­ments au­thor­ing for
a pure func­tion is triv­ial. If this con­di­tion is not true, then the
func­tion must have mem­ory (s­tate). An im­pure func­tion is iden­ti­fied as
one where there is at least one to­ken in­put but a stream out­put.</p>
<p>Many prob­lems can only be solved by im­pure be­hav­iours—any prob­lem that
re­quires in­for­ma­tion to per­sist over time. To keep state away from pure
func­tions, we ini­tially in­tro­duced a new stereo­type of
func­tion—«­s­tore». A «s­tore» func­tion stores the last value of a to­ken
and pro­duces it as a stream of the same type. A store func­tion can then
be placed up­stream of the in­puts of a stream-pro­duc­ing con­trol func­tion
to en­sure that it re­ceives only streams and is pure. With the ad­di­tion
of «s­tore» func­tions, the meta­model of the lan­guage is com­plete with
re­gards to be­ing able to fully ex­press be­hav­iour.</p>
<p>As more fea­tures were analysed us­ing this tech­nique, we no­ticed pat­terns
oc­cur­ring with the in­ter­play be­tween «s­tore» func­tions and «con­trol»
func­tions. One ex­am­ple of this is the state con­trol pat­tern. This
pat­tern is shown in fig­ure 2. It was re­alised that this lit­tle sys­tem of
«s­tore» and «con­trol» func­tions were act­ing equiv­a­lently to a state
ma­chine. There­fore, a new stereo­type of func­tion—«s­tate­ful»—was
cre­ated to en­com­pass this pat­tern. We then en­cour­aged en­gi­neers to draw
state di­a­grams to rep­re­sent the be­hav­iour of these new func­tions to
im­prove com­pre­hen­sion and com­mu­ni­ca­tion of re­quire­ments.</p>
<h2 id="summary-of-the-miso-method"><em>Sum­mary of the Miso Method</em></h2>
<p>Fi­nal­ly, pre­sented is a sum­mary of the steps to the Miso method of
func­tional analy­sis:</p>
<p><strong>Iden­tify the In­ter­face of the Fea­ture</strong>—In the use cases for the
fea­ture at hand, iden­tify where in­for­ma­tion flows across the bound­ary of
the sys­tem. This could be in the form of stake­holder in­ter­ac­tions,
sens­ing the val­ues of en­vi­ron­men­tal mea­sur­ables or ac­tu­at­ing ef­fects.
For each of these iden­ti­fied in­for­ma­tion flows, iden­tify whether they
are a to­ken or a stream and the range of val­ues that it has.</p>
<p><strong>Analyse the De­pen­den­cies Be­tween In­for­ma­tion Flows</strong>—For each of the
ac­tu­a­tions of our sys­tem in the use case we need to iden­tify which of
the stim­uli we want it to de­pend up­on. If there is a de­pen­dency be­tween
an ac­tu­a­tion and a stim­u­lus, the stim­u­lus in­for­ma­tion flow must be an
in­put to the con­trol func­tion of that ac­tu­a­tion. Note that oc­ca­sion­al­ly,
some con­trol func­tions will feed into more than one ac­tu­a­tion.</p>
<p><strong>Iden­tify State</strong>—I­den­tify func­tions with to­kens go­ing in and streams
com­ing out­—these are cases where store or state­ful func­tions are
re­quired. We also iden­tify the need for tim­ing—­such as de­lays or
de­bounces—as this too can be rep­re­sented with state­ful func­tions.</p>
<p><strong>Refac­tor Your De­com­po­si­tion</strong>—No­tice when mul­ti­ple func­tions are
con­sum­ing the same in­for­ma­tion flows and are do­ing some­thing un­der the
same con­di­tions Where this hap­pens, we can cre­ate a new func­tion and
in­for­ma­tion flow to rep­re­sent the con­di­tions be­ing met or not. Note that
new con­trol func­tions should only be cre­ated if the in­for­ma­tion they
pro­duce is used by two or more other con­trol func­tions. This refac­tor­ing
can also be done in re­verse to merge ex­tra­ne­ous con­trol func­tions that
are only pro­vid­ing their in­for­ma­tion to one other con­trol func­tion.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered" id="conclusion-and-further-work">Con­clu­sion and Fur­ther Work</h1>
<p>Re­fin­ing our ap­proach to func­tional ar­chi­tec­ture has given JLR a bet­ter
un­der­stand­ing of its ve­hi­cle sys­tem by al­low­ing us to find
in­ter-re­la­tions be­tween dif­fer­ent be­hav­iours that re­mained im­plicit in
other meth­ods. This led to re­duc­tions in the time taken to per­form work
such as func­tional fail­ure analy­sis, fea­ture re­quire­ments har­mon­i­sa­tion
and re­view­ing of the pro­duced re­quire­ments. The fo­cus on the pos­si­ble
val­ues of in­for­ma­tion flow and whether that flow was a to­ken or stream
greatly aided in the au­thor­ing &amp; re­view­ing of re­quire­ments pro­duced from
func­tional analy­ses.</p>
<p>A re­lated ob­ser­va­tion was that if a func­tional de­com­po­si­tion had been
per­formed by other meth­ods but did have all in­for­ma­tion flows
iden­ti­fied, we could refac­tor it into Miso func­tions. Do­ing this
refac­tor­ing work of­ten iden­ti­fied miss­ing in­for­ma­tion flows in the
orig­i­nal func­tional de­com­po­si­tion of a fea­ture that were ei­ther left
im­plicit by the en­gi­neer or for­got­ten. Al­though fol­low­ing the Miso
method usu­ally re­sults in more func­tions than pre­vi­ous func­tional
analy­sis meth­ods, each func­tion was both eas­ily jus­ti­fi­able and
al­lo­ca­ble to the sub­sys­tems as­sur­ing us that the level of ab­strac­tion
was good.</p>
<p>A ben­e­fit of hav­ing a whole sys­tem func­tional ar­chi­tec­ture model is that
it al­lowed en­gi­neers to more eas­ily find the right in­for­ma­tion flows for
their sys­tem. The model acted as a fo­cal point which al­lowed us to spot
du­pli­ca­tions of be­hav­ior and, there­fore, ef­fort (often due to sim­i­lar
fea­tures de­vel­oped by dif­fer­ent parts of the busi­ness). The fo­cal point
the model pro­vided was use­ful when home work­ing be­gan as it pro­vided a
com­mu­ni­ca­tion chan­nel for re­quire­ments be­tween sys­tems en­gi­neers in
dif­fer­ent parts of the busi­ness that would not have ex­isted oth­er­wise.</p>
<p>The method pre­sented may also be use­ful for mod­el­ling busi­nesses
processes where in­for­ma­tion flow of such a de­com­po­si­tion maps to the
de­liv­er­ables in the process. Fol­low­ing the Miso method for de­scrib­ing
busi­ness process may pro­vide a ‘good fit’ for a no­ta­tion to go with the
points made by Dr Keith Col­lyer in his pa­per “Process Mod­els are not
Flow Chart­s”[­Col­lyer 2020] Cur­rent­ly, busi­ness process mod­el­ling
lan­guages such as ARIS and BPMN are con­trol flow based mak­ing the mod­els
cre­ated in them flow charts. The phrase “In­for­ma­tion is more im­por­tant
than the way you cre­ate it” from his pa­per chimes with the guid­ing
phi­los­o­phy that we fol­lowed when de­vel­op­ing the Miso method.</p>
