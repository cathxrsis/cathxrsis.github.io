<p>In this post, I will de­scribe a pat­tern that I have iden­ti­fied in nu­mer­ous places dur­ing my time as a sys­tems en­gi­neer. This pat­tern sits some­where be­tween the tra­di­tional dou­ble-loop learn­ing sys­tem and a vi­able sys­tem. I call this pat­tern the <em>De­sir­ing Ma­chine</em> as a nod to Deleuze as I feel that this pat­tern <em>feels</em> some­what like a Deleuz­ian de­sir­ing ma­chine. This post fo­cusses mainly on the de­riva­tion of the pat­tern but I hope to ex­pand on its uses as a frame­work for un­der­stand­ing and en­quiry in fu­ture posts. I will add that I do not be­lieve that this pat­tern is any­thing new; I have seen as­pects of it ex­pressed in var­i­ous sys­tems think­ing texts. How­ev­er, I don’t think the pat­tern has been ad­dressed by name or given the recog­ni­tion as a use­ful pat­tern in the way I be­lieve it de­serves.</p>

<h1 id="a-brief-aside-into-notation-and-method">A Brief Aside Into No­ta­tion and Method</h1>
<p>To de­scribe the pat­terns in this post, I will use a min­i­mal­ist no­ta­tion that I’ve set­tled upon for de­scrib­ing dy­namic sys­tems. This is a sim­pli­fied ver­sion of stock and flow di­a­grams used in sys­tems dy­nam­ics. Rounded rec­tan­gles are used to rep­re­sent vari­ables and di­a­monds for processes that evolve them.</p>
<p>For ex­am­ple, here’s a sim­ple sys­tem:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/desire_example.png" width="200" alt="Notational example" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">No­ta­tional ex­am­ple</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>For the method­ol­o­gy, I’ll be show­ing my work­ing as sub­se­quent ap­pli­ca­tions of DSRP. Al­though it is <a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2008.04.002">dis­puted</a> whether DSRP is com­plete, it is a def­i­nitely sim­ple frame­work and good enough for the pur­poses here. I have also used a few laws from var­i­ous sys­tems thinkers, a great sum­mary of these laws can be found in the book <a href="https://www.scio.org.uk/resources/grammar-systems-order-chaos-back">The Gram­mar of Sys­tems: From Or­der to Chaos &amp; Back</a>.</p>
<h1 id="the-loop">The Loop</h1>
<p>Ini­tial­ly, we’ll start from the most sim­ple loop of <em>The Real</em> and the process by which it changes which we’ll call <em>Evo­lu­tion</em>. This leads us to a triv­ial sys­tem look­ing like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/base.png" width="100" alt="The simplest system" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The sim­plest sys­tem</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>I hope that you’ll agree that this is an in­cred­i­bly low res­o­lu­tion model of the uni­verse. The rea­son why I’ve started here is be­cause all sys­tems are in­scribed within the re­al. It’s good to keep in mind that ap­pli­ca­tions of DSRP are all about im­pos­ing struc­ture on a Volatile, Un­know­able, Com­plex and Am­bigu­ous re­al­i­ty—ev­ery­thing that ex­ists is al­ready within this mod­el, we just need re­cur­sive sub­se­quent ap­pli­ca­tions of DSRP to carve our more sub­tle pat­terns from it.</p>
<p>Ash­by’s law of req­ui­site va­ri­ety states that a good reg­u­la­tor must have at least as much va­ri­ety as the en­vi­ron­ment it con­trols. There­fore, along­side the en­vi­ron­ment, there must be a model of that en­vi­ron­ment that we can use to con­trol it. This model is part of <em>the Real</em> so we’ll carve it out of the <em>Real</em> with a dis­tinc­tion. For rea­sons ex­plained lat­er, we’ll call it <em>Un­der­stand­ing</em>:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/desire_understanding.png" width="200" alt="Adding understanding" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Adding un­der­stand­ing</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If we were fol­low­ing DSRP to the let­ter, the cre­ation of a dis­tinc­tion across an el­e­ment would cause the cre­ation of two new el­e­ments within the sys­tem of the orig­i­nal. For the sim­plic­ity of the di­a­grams, we’re ig­nor­ing the sys­tem part for now, as we’re op­er­at­ing from the per­spec­tive of the de­sir­ing ma­chine that we’re de­riv­ing. I hope that this omis­sion will not cause too much con­fu­sion.</p>
<p><em>ER­RA­TUM: I have come to the re­al­i­sa­tion that the Real should be re­placed by the En­vi­ron­ment in the fol­low­ing di­a­grams. The En­vi­ron­ment be­ing a small part of the Real that we care about. The Dark­ness prin­ci­ple (a re­sult of Ash­by’s law) pre­vents us from mak­ing a De­sir­ing Ma­chine that can cope with all of the Real de­spite what the MIT school might at­tempt</em></p>
<p>The third part of mak­ing a dis­tinc­tion is the cre­ation of the re­la­tion­ships be­tween the two new el­e­ments cre­ated by the dis­tinc­tion. These re­la­tion­ships are what we used to de­fine the pur­pose of our dis­tinc­tion so we must in­ter­ro­gate our mo­tives. The rea­son for this en­quiry is to un­der­stand a gen­eral pat­tern for sys­tems that seek to mod­ify the en­vi­ron­ment in the way they see fit, so the first re­la­tion­ship should be <em>Ac­tion</em>. <em>Ac­tion</em> is a process that takes in <em>The Real</em> and <em>Un­der­stand­ing</em> and mod­i­fies <em>The Real</em> to­wards some goal based on <em>Un­der­stand­ing</em>.</p>
<h2 id="doubling-the-loop">Dou­bling the Loop</h2>
<p>This <em>Un­der­stand­ing</em> model rep­re­sents our un­der­stand­ing (fun­ny, that) of the laws of physics and/or the en­vi­ron­ment which the sys­tem con­trols. It al­lows our feed­back loop to be­come a <em>feed­for­ward</em> loop. This means that in­stead of course cor­rect­ing our sys­tems in­ter­ven­tions on the cur­rent state of the en­vi­ron­ment, we can pre­dict where the en­vi­ron­ment will be and make our in­ter­ven­tions based on that.</p>
<p>We must ask our­selves though, where does our <em>Un­der­stand­ing</em> come from? There’s only one place it can come from—<em>the Real</em>. How­ev­er, our knowl­edge of <em>the Real</em> is in­com­plete; there will al­ways be edge be­hav­iours that will sur­prise us. The fact that we can never <em>com­pletely</em> model a sys­tem is known as <em>the dark­ness prin­ci­ple</em>.</p>
<p>Be­cause of this, we can­not take our <em>un­der­stand­ing</em> model for grant­ed—we must add an­other loop that mod­i­fies our <em>un­der­stand­ing</em> based on sur­prises (unen­coun­tered phe­nom­e­na) from <em>the Real</em>. We can call this new process <em>learn­ing</em>.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/desire_learning.png" width="250" alt="Adding learning" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Adding learn­ing</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The pat­tern that we now have is some­times called the <em>Dou­ble loop learn­ing</em> mod­el. This pat­tern cor­re­sponds to places where we are ac­tively up­dat­ing our men­tal mod­el—where we are im­prov­ing our <em>feed­for­ward</em> with <em>feed­back</em>. This is a well un­der­stood pat­tern within Cy­ber­net­ics and has per­me­ated a lot of mod­ern or­gan­i­sa­tional think­ing. It could be said that this pat­tern is the quin­tes­sen­tial Cy­ber­netic pat­tern. For ex­am­ple, this pat­tern gen­er­alises the ubiq­ui­tous OODA loop mod­el.</p>
<h2 id="the-arrow-of-desire">The Ar­row of De­sire</h2>
<p>So far, we’ve de­vel­oped a stan­dard pat­tern for an adap­tive sys­tem. There is a con­cept, though, that we’ve been im­plic­itly talk­ing about that we haven’t ac­counted for in our pat­tern. That con­cept is the <em>pur­pose</em> or <em>goal</em> of the sys­tem. From this point for­ward, we will de­fine that only <em>Ac­tion</em> and <em>Learn­ing</em> can be used to in­ter­act with <em>the Real</em>. This con­straint is jus­ti­fied by the as­sump­tion that in­ter­nal processes of a sys­tem can only op­er­ate upon the <em>un­der­stand­ing</em> of the sys­tem.</p>
<p>To be­gin with talk­ing about pur­pose and goals, we should first make a dis­tinc­tion in the <em>Un­der­stand­ing</em> mod­el. If our sys­tem has a goal then it must be en­coded in the <em>Un­der­stand­ing</em> there­fore we can cut part of our <em>Un­der­stand­ing</em> with a dis­tinc­tion and call it <em>the Ideal</em>. How­ev­er, it is also equally valid to make this dis­tinc­tion out of <em>the Real</em> too—<em>the Ideal</em> could just as eas­ily be out­side of the scope of our sys­tem’s per­spec­tive. This is why I’ve ne­glected the sys­tems part of DSRP be­cause, de­pend­ing on the sit­u­a­tion, the de­sir­ing ma­chine pat­tern can be cut up by sys­tem bound­aries in many ways. This new dis­tinc­tion brings with it a new re­la­tion­ship that we’ll call <em>De­sire</em>. This new re­la­tion­ship is an in­put to the <em>Ac­tion</em> process.</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/desire_desire.png" width="300" alt="Adding desire" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Adding de­sire</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><em>De­sire</em> is the dif­fer­ence be­tween <em>Un­der­stand­ing</em> and <em>the Ideal</em>. It there­fore acts as an er­ror sig­nal that dri­ves <em>Ac­tion</em>. That is to say that if <em>the Ideal</em> and <em>Un­der­stand­ing</em> do not dif­fer, there will be no de­sire and there­fore <em>Ac­tion</em> will not oc­cur. A larger dif­fer­ence be­tween <em>Un­der­stand­ing</em> and <em>the Ideal</em> cre­ates a larger <em>De­sire</em> sig­nal and there­fore dri­ves greater <em>Ac­tion</em>. De­pend­ing on the de­sir­ing ma­chine, <em>De­sire</em> can be a mul­ti­-di­men­sional vec­tor whose ba­sis may not be or­thog­o­nal—that is to say, that more com­plex de­sir­ing ma­chines can pro­duce con­flict­ing <em>De­sire</em> which is caused by in­con­sis­ten­cies in <em>The ideal</em> and/or <em>Un­der­stand­ing</em>.</p>
<p><em>De­sire</em> is not the only re­la­tion­ship be­tween <em>the Real</em>, <em>Un­der­stand­ing</em> and <em>the Ideal</em>. The <em>Learn­ing</em> process is also guided by the dif­fer­ence be­tween <em>Un­der­stand­ing</em> and <em>the Ideal</em>. This sig­nal is anal­o­gous to the idea of at­ten­tion–it acts as a fil­ter of what in­for­ma­tion from <em>the Real</em> is worth in­cor­po­rat­ing into <em>Un­der­stand­ing</em>. For now we will call it <em>Mean­ing</em>:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/desire_meaning.png" width="300" alt="Adding meaning" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Adding mean­ing</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><em>Mean­ing</em> is an im­por­tant sig­nal within the de­sir­ing ma­chine as it en­sures that the <em>un­der­stand­ing</em> does not get over­whelmed with in­for­ma­tion that is not rel­e­vant to the goals of the sys­tem. Along with <em>De­sire</em>, <em>Mean­ing</em> can be used as a lens to un­der­stand many patholo­gies of sys­tems.</p>
<h2 id="critique">Cri­tique</h2>
<p>The fi­nal re­la­tion­ship to cre­ate on the di­a­gram is the one that changes <em>the Ideal</em>. As a de­sir­ing ma­chine only has ac­cess to <em>the Real</em> through <em>Learn­ing</em> and <em>Ac­tion</em>. This is added as the process that cre­ates and mod­i­fies <em>the Ideal</em> and there­fore sets the goals of the de­sir­ing ma­chine. With­out it, there could be no <em>Ideal</em> as this process is the one that cre­ates the dis­tinc­tion in­ter­nally to the <em>Un­der­stand­ing</em> be­tween what is and what is <em>Ideal</em>. On the di­a­gram, it looks like this:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/desire_machinefull.png" width="300" alt="The whole desiring machine" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">The whole de­sir­ing ma­chine</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This di­a­gram demon­strates the pat­tern of the de­sir­ing ma­chine. In fu­ture posts I will ex­plore how this pat­tern can be used as a lens to un­der­stand some patholo­gies within sys­tems but first we will ex­plore how dif­fer­ent de­sir­ing ma­chines can in­ter­act as dif­fer­ent lev­els of ab­strac­tion hi­er­ar­chy.</p>
<h2 id="self-similarity">Self Sim­i­lar­ity</h2>
<p>Like many sys­tems, De­sir­ing ma­chines are of­ten self­-sim­i­lar—the processes within de­sir­ing ma­chines are of­ten them­selves de­sir­ing ma­chines. When we’re work­ing as an en­gi­neer­ing firm, we em­body a de­sir­ing ma­chine. Our cus­tomers, be they in­di­vid­u­als or or­gan­i­sa­tions, also em­body de­sir­ing ma­chines. From the cus­tomer’s per­spec­tive, our en­gi­neer­ing firm looks like one of their <em>Ac­tion</em> processes (re­mem­ber the part about how each of the processes may be a de­sir­ing ma­chine it­self). Note that it’s not ‘De­sir­ing Ma­chines all the way down’; the end of the chain of De­sire is of­ten just a sin­gle or dou­ble cy­ber­netic loop act­ing upon <em>the Real</em>.</p>
<p>The view­point of an <em>Ac­tion</em> process as a de­sir­ing ma­chine is an in­ter­est­ing one to take—we can think of the ex­am­ple of an en­gi­neer­ing firm that’s de­vel­op­ing a sys­tem for a cus­tomer or­gan­i­sa­tion. We can ei­ther view the cus­tomer’s re­quire­ments as a part of our en­vi­ron­ment or we can dis­tin­guish the cus­tomer’s de­sir­ing ma­chine out of the en­vi­ron­ment us­ing a new dis­tinc­tion. The fol­low­ing di­a­gram shows what that looks like:</p>
<figure>
<img src="../images/desire_net.png" width="600" alt="Hierarchy of desiring machines" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Hi­er­ar­chy of de­sir­ing ma­chines</figcaption>
</figure>
<p><em>ER­RATA: The Cus­tomer De­sir­ing Ma­chine should be con­nected to the Learn­ing Process of the low­er-level De­sir­ing Ma­chine</em></p>
<p>The primes show the process and parts of the cus­tomer de­sir­ing ma­chine. We can use this di­a­gram as a lens to un­der­stand some of the patholo­gies caused by the hi­er­ar­chy of two
de­sir­ing ma­chines. For ex­am­ple, the de­sire of the cus­tomer is fil­tered through both the cus­tomer’s <em>un­der­stand­ing</em>, the en­gi­neer­ing fir­m’s <em>mean­ing</em> and the en­gi­neer­ing fir­m’s <em>un­der­stand­ing</em>. This means that the less the two un­der­stand­ings match (and the less mean­ing­ful en­gi­neer’s find the re­quire­ments) the less the en­gi­neered so­lu­tion will meet the cus­tomer’s de­sire. This is an ef­fect that I’d like to ex­plore fur­ther in a fu­ture post.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Con­clu­sion</h1>
<p>I have found the <em>De­sir­ing Ma­chine</em> pat­tern model use­ful in my own prac­tice for un­der­stand­ing and di­ag­nos­ing prob­lems of sys­tems en­gi­neer­ing. I hope that I have ex­plained it well enough here for oth­ers to un­der­stand it and to ap­ply it in their own sys­tems prac­tice. I do not be­lieve that I have added any­thing new dur­ing this in­quiry, but I think the pat­tern is use­ful enough to war­rant be­ing named.</p>
<p>I’d be es­pe­cially in­ter­ested to know where it does­n’t work well and ad­di­tion­s/­sub­trac­tions are greatly ap­pre­ci­at­ed. Please put any thoughts that you might have in the com­ments be­low.</p>
<p>In fu­ture posts, I hope to ex­pand on my ideas around the de­sir­ing ma­chine, show­ing how it can be used to un­der­stand the vi­able sys­tems model as well as other con­cepts in sys­tems en­gi­neer­ing. I’d also like to aug­ment my model of the de­sir­ing ma­chine with the idea of sys­tem ca­dences or rhythms to gain un­der­stand­ing of how the pat­tern changes when in­for­ma­tion flows at dif­fer­ent rates around the sys­tem. There’s also some in­ter­est­ing in­sights to be had when the S part of DSRP is put back in so that we have dif­fer­ent ways of cut­ting up the de­sir­ing ma­chine with sys­tem bound­aries.</p>
