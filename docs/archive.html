<p>What is system Architecture?</p>

<p>He clarified by asking what distinguishes architecture from design. A daunting question, especially as the interviewer was the author of a well known primer on systems architecture that I’d not long ago read. I got the job, but I was unhappy with my answer to the question. Three years and a lot of self research into cybernetics later, I think I’m ready to give an answer that I’m happy with. On the way to answer this question we’ll meet a mad major who could build snowmobiles and the Architect (of buildings) whose work paved the way for MBSE.</p>

<p><strong>Risk</strong> [noun]—A potential scenario in a project that is recorded in a risk management plan and forgotten about until it manifests as an issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m being facetious but this doesn’t seem too off the mark as a definition in many engineering organisations. Risk and risk management are fundamental to systems engineering–after all, Risk Management is one of the ISO 15288 processes which defines its purpose as:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>… to identify, analyse, treat and monitor the risks continually.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Risk management as usually practiced certainly fails this definition. This proposes the question: what is risk and how should it be managed? Although following ISO 15288 and the SE handbook will get you through a project’s risk management adequately, I believe treating risk this way alienates the concept from the engineering process.</p>
<p>In this blog post, I’d like to explore the idea of risk and to Make the point that risk is not just something to be managed on the side of an engineering project but a fundamental part of engineering that provides a motive, measure and direction for an engineering project itself in a way that other measures cannot.</p>
<p>On the way, we’ll explore concepts from the scrum framework and a contender for the philosophical definition of life itself.</p>

<p>My null hypothesis is this: compared to other disciplines of engineering, there are proportionally far fewer <em>vocational</em> systems engineers. By <em>vocational</em>, I am referring to the idea of engineers who see the subject of their job as more than just what they do 9-5 to pay the bills.</p>

This post focusses mainly on the derivation of the pattern but I hope to expand on its uses as a framework for understanding and enquiry in future posts. I will add that I do not believe that this pattern is anything new; I have seen aspects of it expressed in various systems thinking texts. However, I don’t think the pattern has been addressed by name or given the recognition as a useful pattern in the way I believe it deserves.</p>

This time in UML &amp; SysML (this also applies to simulink, but this is by no means the limits of my quibbles with Matlab). SysML has a few behavioural diagram types: the use case diagram (allegedly), the sequence diagram, the activity diagram, the parametrics diagram (though they’re considered different for some reason?) and the state machine diagram. After the sequence diagram, the state machine diagram is probably the most used diagram for behavioural specification. In this blog post, I’m going to tell you why that’s bad.</p>
