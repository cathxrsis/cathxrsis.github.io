In Stafford Beer's set of lectures, *Designing Freedom*, he describes an analogy for modern organisational systems. Imagine two managers sat on poles some distance apart. Between these two managers is a ball suspended with two pieces of string which the managers hold the other ends. The goal of this system is to hold the ball as close to still as possible. Every so often a small gust of wind might cause the ball to wobble at which point the two managers will wiggle the string until the ball again falls still.

However, disaster for this system strikes when a cat comes along. The cat spots the ball and begins to play with it, batting it to and fro with its paws. The managers do not have the control to stop the ball from wobbling anymore as the cat is disturbing the ball faster than the managers can counter. There are many ways that this system could be redesigned to cope with this kind of disturbance, however, as Beer observed, often the managers just kill the cat.

Killing the cat can be seen as a refusal to learn from new information. When designing systems (or building our mental models of reality) we are rarely presented with the complete set of information about the system's environment---there are always surprises and shocks in the future that we cannot account for. Killing the cat occurs when one of these shocks happens and instead of modifying the system to cope with that shock in the future, we instead modify the system's environment so that the shock does not occur.

Modern agriculture can be seen as a case of where killing the cat has severe knock-on effects. Pre-industrial farming @@ However, the goal change to maximisation of profit-per-acre meant that the landowners began to reduce their greatest cost---wages. Because of this, any technology that could reduce the number of hands required to farm an acre was embraced.

One such technology was the introduction of the monoculture field. The monoculture field is @@EXPLAIN
