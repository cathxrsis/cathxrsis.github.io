The hierarchical structure of modern organisations is often justified using the argument of meritocracy. @@

Part 1: Peter and Paula
------------------------

The Peter principle is a somewhat tongue-in-cheek counter-argument to the meritocracy justification of hierarchy that goes something like this:

1) If you are good at your job, you will be promoted

2) If you excel in the company, you will continue to be promoted until you are in a role that you are not good at.

3) It is hard to remove someone from a position once they are in it, except through promotion.

4) In time, New competent people will have to wait for a place above them to vacate (through retirement or death).

Therefore, given enough time, the upper echelons of an organisation's management will be incompetent.

The pe

One might ask: Why is it that incompetent people in middle managment don't get fired? The explanation for this one in the model is that to fire an incompetent worker, their manager has to admit that they made a mistake in hiring the said worker and therefore admit themselves to a level of incompetence. @@

Part 3: The Helium Crypto-Racist
-------------------------

Let's now explore another side-effect of this model of hierarchical management that we are constructing, this time concerning how organisations can end up biased. Let's imagine we have an engineer called Tim. Tim is a very clever engineer, he is incredibly confident, ambitious and charismatic. Unfortunately, Tim is a white supremacist.

Eventually, Tim finds himself a few levels below the CEO of his company with a few hundred engineers working for him. He begins to feel safe in his job and no longer @@ When he's in meetings with his subordinates, Tim begins to crack the odd antisemitic joke. Some of the engineers belly-laugh, some nervously titter. Tim makes an unconscious mental note of the engineers that don't laugh; they're boring and stuck-up and they'll not be promoted by him. The Jewish engineer in that meeting suddenly feels that they're an outsider in space that used to feel safe to them. The engineers who want to be in Tim's good books for promotions may even start cracking racist jokes too to impress Tim.

All too often, in situations like this, the sufferers of aggression and micro-aggression will up sticks and leave the company. In cases where they take their grievances to HR, they can also come up against a wall as management will find it hard to admit that they have not only hired a racist but put them in a high position of power. 

The mechanism above shows one likely path that an organisation can become institutionally discriminatory even if the vast majority of its staff do not hold prejudices.

Part 4: Communication vs Power
------------------------------

There is no way of getting around the fact that a complex project requires a communication structure that allows for strategy and tactics to coexist. We see this most obviously with armies where
