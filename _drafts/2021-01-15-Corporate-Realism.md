description: What does politics and common sense have to do with engineering? It turns out, quite a lot. Perhaps engineering is not quite as separate from sociology as we'd like to believe.

Systems Engineering the Organisation
====================================

If your organisation creates a complex system and the architecture is more complex than it needs to be, take a look at your organisation's org chart. Chances are, the two things will match. You can often tell which of the two was designed first @@

​

From the earlier chapter on ontology and postmodernism, its quite easy to see how we engineers can sometimes delude ourselves into thinking our field is entirely rational and therefore @@

Common sense, Corporate Realism and Hypernormalisation
======================================================

The psychoanalyst Jaques Lacan described the phenomenon of the "Big Other" as the commonly held set of rules and knowledge that we use to navigate social situations in day to day life. It forms a sort of "communal ontology" of a society and is often what is referred to as "common sense". Many philosophers, notably Slavoj Zizek and Mark Fisher, have written about how the big other (or common sense) can define which ideas we can and cannot talk about within a certain context. In the corporate space this forms a set of constraints that guide an organisation's engineering (and business) practice. 

In many cases, common sense forms important parts of the social contract in business; "professional behaviour" (a more corporate way of saying common sense) provides us with a set of social rules that allow us to perform business without offending people and even helps us work with people we really wouldn't get on with outside of the walls of the office.

Corporate Realism
-----------------

Corporate realism can form one of the largest challenges facing any concerted effort to perform system's engineering within an organisation. You may have come across it yourself within a company where the daily practice of the engineers does not match the written processes. This may be because the written processes are outdated, bad and/or incomplete. Managerial pressure to cut corners (without understanding the cost consequences of doing so) can also be a cause; forcing engineers into creating a physical product before they've had a chance to properly analyse the customers' needs is a relatively common phenomenon.

Corporate realism is shown in a rather extreme way in the 2000 film American Psycho. [SPOILERS] In this film, Christian Bales' Patrick Bateman performs a number of increasingly horrific acts before having a breakdown and confessing to his lawyer. The true horror of the film comes when Bateman finds that he has made no impact on his reality whatsoever, the corporate realism of the New York yuppieism completely nullifies evidence of his crimes leaving the audience questioning whether or not the horror scenes of the movie actually occurred.

We're systems engineers not serial killers (at least I hope not) but many of us have already experienced the maddening alienation of your work being nullified. Often by being disregarded from the process. In one area of an organisation the author worked in, the author witnessed a systems teams work disregarded as the downstream team were told to do their work without the upstream team's requirements. The reason was that the manager wanted results sooner. Hilariously, the downstream team's work was also nullified by team downstream of them in exactly the same manner.

Hypernormalisation
------------------

In extreme cases, corporate realism can evolve into a state of hypernormalisation. First described by soviet professor of Anthropology, Alexei Yurchak, hypernormalisation is the state achieved when common sense no longer matches the lived reality. Hypernormalisation was first used to refer to the state of being within the soviet union during the period after the space race. During this period of time it was obvious to soviet citizens that the USSR was failing; general standards of living were getting worse despite government measures and reports saying otherwise. 

Yet the common sense in soviet thought disallowed mentioning the failures of the system and, more insidiously, speaking about alternatives. This left the soviet people in a state of depressive doublethink; a hopeless state where everyone could see the problems, and mostly, individually, knew the solutions but were unable to voice them in a serious way due to the soviet realism bearing down upon them. 

It was the shock of the Chernobyl disaster and  Gorbachev's voicing of the problems in his perestroika policies that shattered the illusion of soviet "common sense" and brought an end to the soviet era. This paved the way for neoliberalism, the form of capitalism that dominates our world today, to become the new "common sense" in Russia. The author encourages the reader to think of examples in their own experience where hypernormalisation is occuring.

Hypernormalisation in the workplace
-----------------------------------

On the corporate level, experiencing hypernormalisation can be a harrowing experience for engineers. @@ 

Positivity: You're just a negative person, stop being so negative. This is a very effective tactic used by managers and engineers when they want to silence someone. Being tarred as a "negative person"

Exceptionalism: our company is different. T

The death march: This project is doomed from the start, but we've already committed X million for it.

@@

In the words of the architect of neoliberalism himself, Milton Friedman:

“Only a crisis - actual or perceived - produces real change. When that crisis occurs, the actions that are taken depend on the ideas that are lying around. That, I believe, is our basic function: to develop alternatives to existing policies, to keep them alive and available until the politically impossible becomes the politically inevitable.”

Perhaps the best way to implement systems engineering in a large organisation may be to define a coherent and complete process ready for the next big crisis to occur. But even when the crisis comes you may find that the corporate realism you find yourself in refuses to die. And you thought this section couldn't get more depressing?
