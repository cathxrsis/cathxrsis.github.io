In the Oscar winning 2015 film Mad Max: Fury Road, the protagonist of the story, Imperator Furiosa, saves the members of her warlord's harem in attempt to free them and take them to her homeland: The Green Place. And thus begins the greatest film about a car chase across the post-apocalyptic australian outback ever made. Before you read on, I urge you to go watch the film because, of course, there's going to be spoilers.

The heroes of the film finally lose the @@ 

Its at the climax of the film that we see the narrator, the titular Max, regain his humanity. Max begins the film in a beast like state. Driven by fear, hunger and running away from the memories of those that he could not save. Whilst watching Furiosa and the many mothers enter the plains of silence, Max has a vision of the girl he could not save which leads him to suggest to Furiosa that there is a green place: back at Immortan Joe's citadel.

During these scenes, we see a lesson in this story about loss. The Green place becoming a poisoned swampland inhabited by crows and stilt-walkers can be read as the innocence of childhood; the home that we can never return to. In the case of Furiosa, this innocence has been destroyed from the abuse that she and the other women have endured at the hands of Immortan Joe; their innocence and happiness have been destroyed by the same toxic masculine forces that poisoned the green place. This link is constantly hinted at in the film with the recurring question: Who killed the world?

The question is never answered, to the characters in the story its rhetorical. Immortan Joe is angered by it. The women of the story accept the question knowingly. Leaving this question unanswered explicitly in the film invites us, the audience to answer it. Who killed the world?

## Formaldehyde

As a child, I went to a state comprehensive school built in the 70s. In the biology classrooms, between gaudy displays of mitosis backed with brightly coloured sugar paper were shelves with jars on. In these jars were frogs, small animals and organs. All of them a lifeless beige suspended in clear liquid. Formaldehyde. It struck me that not only were these lumps of meat dead, but in preserving their intricate structures, the formaldehyde had bleached the pigments from the specimens. Unlike the brightly patterned butterflies pinned behind glass in the other cabinets, the pickled specimens looked like they may have never been alive. The small yellowing label on each jar with the name of the species was the only clue to the fact that there was once a living being associated with each floating beige corpse.

To create a pickled specimen, one has to enact violence. The animal has to be killed and drained of fluid. 

We see this tendency in 

## The Green Place

The green place is dead, toxic, drained of all life and colour. Without hope, Furiosa would have led the women to certain death into the aptly named plains of silence. In today's pickled society of 80's nostalgia, and cultural regurgitation, (In keeping, Mad Max itself is a revisit of an 80's cult series) Fury Road reminds us that we can't go back to the safety of childhood, and without hope we can only disappear into silence. @@ Life is change, holding onto what we've lost can only bring us death in the form of the pickled beige corpse of the former society.

From the past, Furiosa is given the seeds to build a new society. Furiosa does not clutch those seeds as relics like the Vulvalini, doomed to ride the plains of silence @@, she heroically brings them back to the citadel. This process @@

As a society, we can learn from Furiosa and the women of the story; let us not clutch onto a dying system like Immortan Joe. Let us not be like the vuvalini either; clutching onto the seeds of the past @@ History hasn't ended, it hasn't even yet begun.
