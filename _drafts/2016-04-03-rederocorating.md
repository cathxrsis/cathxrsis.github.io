* This is a short paragraph to test the various features of the build.
* This text is *Emphasised*. And this is **Stronger**.
* This is the beginning of some code:

  ```public static int main()
  {
    printf('hello world!')
    return 0;
  }```

* And this is a bit of LaTeX maths:

$$ \frac{a}{b^{2}} = x^{i}y_{i} $$

  ```Let Factory = () => ({produce : 'chocolate'});```
