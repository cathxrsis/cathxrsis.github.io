Its been over ten years since EARS was introduced to the engineering world from its inception in Rolls Royce. In that time the Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax has become a de facto standard for best practice in the engineering industry. I


> A requirements grammar is a way of expressing statements of need for behaviour, performance and/or structure, unambiguously to a human in a human readable format.

> A programming language is a means of expressing a statement of need for behaviour and/or structure, unambiguously to a machine in a human readable format.

We could also note that it is desirable for a requirements grammar to be machine consumable so that we can take advantage of the ability for machines to @@ It is also desirable for a programming language to be able to express some form of constraints within their language, especially if it allows us to reason logically about our code. A programming language with which one can discount certain errors as mathematically impossible is a useful language indeed. Though certain things like timing performance and 
Because of the similarity between these two desciptions, the following, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, law can be deduced:

> Any sufficiently complete requirements language becomes indistinct from a programming language.

This law is definitely bourne out with the OCL language and the new syntax of SysML
