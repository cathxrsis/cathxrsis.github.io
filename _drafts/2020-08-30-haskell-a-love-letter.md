Its been over ten years since EARS was introduced to the engineering world from its inception in Rolls Royce. In that time the Easy Approach to Requirements Syntax has become a de facto standard for best practice in the engineering industry. 


> A requirements grammar is a way of expressing statements of need for behaviour, performance and/or structure, unambiguously to a human in a human readable format.

> A programming language is a means of expressing a statement of need for behaviour and/or structure, unambiguously to a machine in a human readable format.

We could also note that it is desirable for a requirements grammar to be machine consumable so that we can take advantage of the ability for machines to @@ It is also desirable for a programming language to be able to express some form of constraints within their language, especially if it allows us to reason logically about our code. A programming language with which one can discount certain errors as mathematically impossible is a useful language indeed. Though certain things like timing performance and mathematical accuracy are 
Because of the similarity between these two desciptions, the following, somewhat tongue-in-cheek, law can be deduced:

> Any sufficiently complete requirements language becomes indistinct from a programming language.

This law is definitely bourne out with the OCL language and the new written syntax of SysML. &&

Imperative vs Declarative
=========================

The advent of software engineering had profound effects on systems engineering. Software is the most efficient way of achieving a high "behaviour per unit mass or volume" in engineering and therefore allows us to fit ever more complex systems into ever smaller spaces. As systems engineering deals with complexity in all its forms, the fact that software enables higher complexity has meant that the discipline has been influenced greatly by software engineering. In fact, many of the tools and practices used in modern systems engineering came from the software engineering world as software engineers had to grapple with the unprecedented complexity of their discipline. Agile processes and object-oriented MBSE are good examples of this.

The mother discipline of systems engineering is controls engineering---we still use the principles of control loops today in our work. Though something happened in the latter half of the last century to systems engineering methods that @@ Systems engineering entered discrete time.
