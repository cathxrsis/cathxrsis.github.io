$$ P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B)}{P(A)}P(A) $$

This is Bayes' Theorem. It was first written down by Thomas Bayes at some point in the 17th century. It was then not published until after his death and then forgotten about for a few hundred years whilst the scientific community had better things to do.

Unless you are a mathematician who enjoys the field of probability (read: a masochist), then you have, in all probability, not come across this particular theorem.
