Systems engineers tend to think imperatively. Imperative thinking's trademark is t @@

A symptom of this way of thinking is the proliferation of sequence diagrams in MBSE projects.
Even when activity diagrams are used, control flow is often used to move from action to action.

The main

Whilst researching for this post, I watched a [video lecture](@@link) by noted programming language designer Philip Wadler (a contributor to Haskell). In this video, Wadler takes us through the joint history of type theory and computer science. Wadler makes a notable point towards the end of the video where he makes a distinction between *invented* and *discovered* programming languages. The distinction can be explained as follows: invented languages are those where the syntax has been designed over time to solve problems as they appear in the world of computer science.

The history of programming languages is littered with examples of invented languages; Assembly languages were invented to make chip instruction sets easier to work with; C was invented to allow programmes to be written in one language and compiled onto many different chip architectures \&c. Discovered languages, however, are just notations for type theory. For example, LISP is just an executable version of the simply typed lambda calculus and Haskell is "syntactic sugar" on top of the type theory *system F*.

UML and SysML are definitely examples of invented languages.
