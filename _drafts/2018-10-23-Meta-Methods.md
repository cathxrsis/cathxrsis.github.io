An interesting conversation occurred in my local church tower the other day where one of my fellow ringers told me that Grandsire Doubles is an extension of Plain Bob Minimus. One of the older members of the tower<sup>1</sup> then pointed out that Grandsire Doubles is probably a more *correct* extension as it adds only an extra hunt bell and avoids having the 5th bell making four blows behind.

Grandsire Doubles adds an extra hunt bell to Plain Bob Minimus whereas Plain Bob Doubles adds an extra method bell and accomodates it by adding long places behind at the lead end over the dodge.

How either of these extension methods can be considered more *correct* is mainly aesthetics over whether you find Gransire or Plain Bob doubles more elegant.

This got me thinking though, are there other ways to extend methods that conform to the rules of bells only swapping one place? Well this is where *meta-methods* enter.

To begin with, we must first generate a basis for extending methods that preserves the one place swap rule. We can define the devonian action of bell $$ n $$ swapping places with $$ n+1 $$ (or $$ n $$ with $$ n-1 $$ for those oddballs who call down) with the notation: $$ C_{n,n+1} $$.

For a five bells (doubles) the set of changes are:

$$ \{ C_{1,2}, C_{2,3}, C_{3,4}, C_{4,5}  \} $$.



$$ 1 2 3 4 5 $$

$$ 2 1 3 4 5 $$

$$ 2 3 1 4 5 $$

$$ 2 3 4 1 5 $$
