Activity diagrams get used a lot in systems engineering for all sorts of purposes. Of all the SysML diagrams, they are probably the most information dense. In fact, activities are often used when a set of sequence diagrams would be more appropriate because you can show more behaviour in one place (the same tendency occurs for state machine diagrams).
