There are many ways to classify the different programming languages that have been used over the years. The famous computer scientist Philip Wadler came up with one distinction that is somewhat tongue-in-cheek but interesting non the less. The two categories are this: Programming languages that are invented and programming languages that are discovered. The argument for classification is this: if we were to meet an alien civilisation and send them a programme to run, what language would you send that programme in? A program sent in C++ or Java is likely to confound the aliens as these languages have been evolved over the years from languages that were easy to design compilers to machine code in. However, if we were to send a programme written in a Lisp dialect or part of the ML family (like Haskell) the aliens would have a much better time deciphering it and compiling it. Why? Because these languages are built atop the lambda calculus and are just notations for logic itself.

Why should we care though? the world has been working well enough with "discovered" languages since FORTRAN. There are a lot of benefits that we can get from using variants of the lambda calculus as programming languages for the simple reason that a mathematical basis gives you the power of mathematical proof.
