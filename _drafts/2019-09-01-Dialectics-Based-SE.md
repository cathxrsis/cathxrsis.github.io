Progress is often a tricky subject in large organisations. Many engineers @@

The story generally goes like this: an organisation has a *golden period*, makes some really good products or services and @@ After a few years the shine starts to wear off; with the same workers, processes, tools and methods the new products of the organisation begin to drop in quality and/or creep in price.

- Symptoms - A luxury car is same order of magnitude of engineering time as a cheap one. If a company can only make luxury cars, its probably crap at engineering. 

- everyone knows the solutions
- management

- Goal orientation fails because
- Method orientation is good because
- Continuous tension labour time
- Beware the false synthesis

# Beware the false synthesis!

The false synthesis is an interesting idea when developing new processes for an organisation. A false synthesis is when changes are proposed that don't address the underlying contradictions in the dialectic.

- The most important question is why? get down to the assumptions

- Get the engineer to find the inherent contradictions in their own methods by

As a slight aside, I was once @@. As I continued my questioning, the engineer in question got angrier and angrier. Fair enough, I thought, My incessant questioning was pretty annoying. But eventually, in response to one of my questions, the engineer blurted: *I have a degree from [very prestigious university], so I know!*. It struck me then that the assumptions the engineer had as evidence for the soundness of their solution was their own intelligence (Which, I hasten to add, was obviously greater than my own). Therefore, from their point of view, I was not questioning whether they had taken into account the right stakeholders and scenarios during their requirements phase but rather questioning their brain power.

It seemed to me that some engineers see University as a gauntlet to run that gets you a licence to make ad hoc decisions rather than the skills required to @@.

I've certainly seen an aversion to doing maths amongst the engineering community, even amongst those who were obviously very good at it.
