As a systems engineer, I have stumbled across an odd problem within my field. Across industries and companies, managers and engineers agree that their products would be cheaper and more dependable if only the company would start "systems engineering". This usually results in a group of managers procuring a "complete systems engineering lifecycle" toolset from someone like IBM or PTC. The Vee lifecycle is then dusted off from one of the managers Loughborough first year lecture notes. Visio and excel are banned. DOORS and Rhapsody are mandated. Mechanical engineers are heard weeping in their sleep.

But what has caused the rollout of systems engineering to become so sisyphean across industry? Many engineers will be familiar with the kafkaesque task of working out the state of a product when configuration management has failed. In the companies where systems process exists some engineers will recognise the equally kafkaesque task of attempting a fix in a product design where all change requests must be signed in blood by the CEO.
