    <p>Welcome to my blog about systems engineering and systems theory. </p> 

<p> Here is where I like to write about the systems engineering praxis and politics that I have encountered during my career. A short bio can be found in the About Me tab. A list of posts can be found in the Archive tab. I am also keeping a list of anti-patterns that I have identified in the Anti-Patterns tab.</p>

<p>I hope that you find the contents of this blog interesting and maybe even useful!</p>
