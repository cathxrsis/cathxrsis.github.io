**Tom Westbury** is an engineer located in the home counties. He has a fondness for skateboarding, left wing politics, physics and motorcycle restoration. Tom also likes to make lots of noise on a regular basis with his so called "band".

Over the years, Tom has managed to acquire a Physics degree and a massive amount of (mostly useless) knowledge. This blog was created so that this knowledge could be offloaded onto you, the unsuspecting reader.

This blog was hacked together from bits of old code using Jekyll.
